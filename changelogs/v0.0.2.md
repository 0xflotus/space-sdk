# CHANGELOG

## v0.0.2

This release adds more user and identity features to the space-sdk.

### New Features

- `Users.backupKeysByPassphrase` - Backup existing identity using a passphrase.
- `Users.recoverKeysByPassphrase` - Recover existing identity using a passphrase.

### New Fixes

- `UserStorage` logic has been updated to now fetch buckets in threads similar to existing
accounts created in the space-daemon. Existing accounts (identities) from space-daemon can
  retrieve their data via the sdk.
