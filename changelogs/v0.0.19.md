# CHANGELOG

## v0.0.19

This release contains sharing new methods on the `UserStorage` class.

### Features
- Implementation of `UserStorage.getNotifications`. This returns a list of notifications
  for a user. Currently, invitations to access a file can be gotten from the mailbox.
  
### Fixes
- `UserStorage.getFilesRecentlySharedWith()` was renamed to `UserStorage.getRecentlySharedWith()`.
- Stub implementations of `User.Storage.getRecentlySharedWith()` and `UserStorage.getFilesSharedByMe()` have been
replaced with their actual implementation.
