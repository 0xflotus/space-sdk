# CHANGELOG

## v0.0.5

This release contains some fixes to logic of existing functionality.

### New Features

- Manage Users Bucket Metadata with GunDB
- Track files mimetype. `UserStorage.addItems` request now requires specifying the files `mimeType`
and `UserStorage.openFile` returns the files `mimeType` in its response object.

### New Fixes

- Fix `UserStorage.listDirectory`'s response to have compatible `date` and `address` fields.
